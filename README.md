# Ray's toolshed

This documents so  the tools in Ray's shed so those of us that are not handy can remember what they are used for, and what we own that has been built with them.

Sketch the shape of the tools, so that each has a place on the peg board. |

This is for timber docking, cutting off lengths and cut can be at various angles. I cut some firewood on it recently. Mostly used for pine board, chip board, masonite. Can cut a 2' piece of board by cutting half, turning around and cutting other half.|
